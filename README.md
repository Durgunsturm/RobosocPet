# RoboSoc-Pet
 Dedicated to all the process, prototypes and development of a simulated robot pet.

There are two bots this project worked on, dark and plywood.
A lot of files are older and probably don't work anymore,
however they are being kept as they can help your understanding of the project.

Programs may have incorrect pins assigned to them,
so ensure to update the pins in the programs if you rewire the bots.

Finally, the dark bot used a sonar in front and two sonars either side,
and the plywood bot used a single sonar in front or an IR sensor.

Directories:

- Animal directory is for basically finished programs.

- Basic_Movements is an old directory with completed code made earlier in the project.

- Lib & lib-pack are libaries that most programs call from, using them simplies code as essential functions are centralised

- Notes is obvious

- Sensors is for specific tests for each type of sensor
