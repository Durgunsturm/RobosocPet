Look at sonar from behind with wires facing down, wires ordered left to right
Front sonar:
 - GND -> Ground breadboard         Green           Disconnected
                                    //Echo and Trig are connected to A1 and A0 respectively, which seems backwards to what is stated in programs
 - Echo -> Pin A0                   Purple->Yellow  Disconnected
 - Trig -> Pin A1                   White->Orange   Disconnected
 - Vcc -> Power breadboard          White->Red      Disconnected

Right sonar:
 - GND -> Ground breadboard         Orange->Blue    n/a
 - Echo -> Pin 12                   Orange->Yellow  n/a
 - Trig -> Pin 13                   Red->Black      n/a
 - Vcc -> Power breadboard          Brown->White    n/a

Left sonar:
 - GND -> Ground breadboard         Brown->Blue     n/a
 - Echo -> Pin 3                    White->Purple   n/a
 - Trig -> Pin 2                    Yellow->Green   n/a
 - Vcc -> Power breadboard          Purple->Red     n/a

IR sensor:
 - VIN -> Power breadboard          n/a             Red
 - GND -> Ground breadboard         n/a             Grey
 - SDA -> SDA                       n/a             White->Orange
 - SCL -> SCL                       n/a             Brown->Yellow
 - INT -> n/a
 - SHUT -> n/a
